              <p>
                What began as a small studio with a handful of designers has grown into a 
                respected brand known for quality craftsmanship and sustainable practices.

              <ul className="space-y-4 mt-6">
                <li>
                  <strong>Design Excellence</strong> - We believe that great design improves lives.
                  Every product we create undergoes rigorous design and usability testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sustainability</strong> - We're committed to reducing environmental impact
                  through recycled materials, minimal packaging, and long-lasting products.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Innovation</strong> - We constantly explore new materials, technologies,
                  and manufacturing processes to stay at the cutting edge of our industry.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mt-12 mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
              <p>
                Every PLASTIC product starts with identifying a need or opportunity to improve
                everyday living. Our design team then sketches, prototypes, and iterates until
                we've crafted something that perfectly balances form and function. We source
                high-quality, sustainable materials and work with trusted manufacturing partners
                who share our commitment to excellence.
              </p>
